      <h2>REVOLVERS</h2>
      <h3>Cattleman revolver</h3>

      <p>
        A popular and classic sidearm, the Buck Cattleman is a great all-around
        revolver, featuring a good balance of damage, accuracy and fire rate.
        Suited for close to medium-range combat, this gun can also be
        dual-wielded and used on horseback. This gun has an ammo capacity of six
        rounds, and can use Regular, High Velocity, Split Point, Express and
        Explosive revolver ammo.
      </p>
      <h3>Schofield</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/schofieldrevolver.png"
        alt=""
        width="400"
        height="400"
        class="img1"
      />
      <p>
        The powerful Hutton & Baird Schofield is an accurate revolver with high
        damage, making a good choice for any serious gunslinger. Despite a
        slower firing rate and reload speed, when compared with other revolvers,
        it can still be dual wielded to great effect. This gun has an ammo
        capacity of six rounds, and can use Regular, High Velocity, Split Point,
        Express and Explosive revolver ammo.
      </p>
      <h3>Double action revolver</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/doubleactionrevolver.png"
        alt=""
        width="400"
        height="400"
        class="img1"
      />
      <p>
        The D.D. Packenbush Double-action Revolver is a fast-firing weapon with
        relatively low damage. The advanced mechanism prevents the need to cock,
        at the cost of a heavy trigger pull and lower accuracy. The quick-fire
        rate makes this a good choice for mounted combat. This gun has an ammo
        capacity of six rounds and can use Regular, High Velocity, Split Point,
        Express, and Explosive revolver ammo.
      </p>
      <h3>Le mat revolver</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/lematrevolver.png"
        alt=""
        width="400"
        height="400"
        class="img1"
      />
      <p>
        The LeMat is a cap and ball revolver with a single-shot, smooth bore
        barrel of buckshot beneath the main barrel, allowing players to switch
        between revolver and shotgun ammunition at their leisure. The LeMat
        revolver is a very powerful but very slow-acting gun; with Revolver
        Ammo, it possesses the highest damage of all in-game revolvers, with its
        damage and accuracy being both marginally better than the Schofield
        Revolver and Volcanic Pistol and decisively superior to that of both the
        Double-action and Cattleman revolvers. With Express Ammo, this becomes
        even more exaggerated, with the LeMat revolver's damage now being
        comparable to some of the weaker rifles. However, as a downside, both
        its rate of fire and reload speed are the slowest of all in-game
        revolvers, although the latter factor is somewhat mitigated in that the
        ammo capacity is nine rounds as opposed to the default six. With Shotgun
        Ammo, the LeMat performs similarly to the Sawed-off Shotgun, except it
        has one round available instead of two.
      </p>

      <h2>PISTOLS</h2>
      <h3>Volcanic pistol</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/volcanicpistol.png"
        alt=""
        width="400"
        height="400"
        class="img1"
      />
      <p>
        The Hutton & Baird Volcanic Pistol combines the stopping power of a
        repeating rifle with the portability of a sidearm. Although the accuracy
        is good, the slow firing rate and reload speed mean that you'd better
        hit your target with the first shot. This gun has an ammo capacity of
        eight rounds, and can use Regular, High Velocity, Split Point, Express
        and Explosive pistol ammo.
      </p>
      <h3>Semiautomatic pistol</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/semiautomaticpistol.png"
        alt=""
        width="400"
        height="400"
        class="img1"
      />
      <p>
        The new Peeters & Janssens Semi-Automatic Pistol deals less damage than
        revolver sidearms, but makes up for it by doing away with the need for
        weapon cocking, as well as an expanded ammo capacity and quicker
        magazine reloads. This gun has an ammo capacity of eight rounds and can
        use Regular, High Velocity, Split Point, Express and Explosive pistol
        ammo. The Semi-Automatic Pistol has the lowest damage of all firearms in
        the game, but it has a slightly higher magazine count than most, with 8
        rounds, the fastest fire rate in the game, fairly high accuracy and a
        very quick reload time.
      </p>
      <h3>Mauser</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/mauserrepeaterpistol.png"
        alt=""
        width="400"
        height="400"
        class="img1"
      />
      <p>
        A new import from Germany, the MÃ¼hlberg Mauser is a modern
        semi-automatic pistol with a low damage. The rapid fire rate of this
        weapon, along with a large ammo capacity, make this a good choice for
        close range combat, or when surrounded by multiple enemies. This gun has
        an ammo capacity of ten rounds, and can use Regular, High Velocity,
        Split Point, Express and Explosive pistol ammo.
      </p>
      <h3>1899 pistol</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/1899 semiautomaticpistol.png"

      <p>
        Only stocked by the best gunsmith in Saint Denis, the M1899 by Peeters &
        Janssens is a thoroughly modern sidearm. A semi-automatic handgun, the
        M1899 deals good damage at short range, and its magazine-loaded
        ammunition allows for a swift reload. This gun has an ammo capacity of
        eight rounds and can use Regular, High Velocity Split Point, Express,
        and Explosive pistol ammo.

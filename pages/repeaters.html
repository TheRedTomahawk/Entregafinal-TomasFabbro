      <p>
        A reliable and popular repeating rifle, the Buck Carbine provides medium
        damage and a decent firing rate, with quick reload speeds thanks to the
        tube-loaded magazine in the weapon's stock. A good, balanced choice for
        hunting and medium-range combat, this gun has an ammo capacity of seven
        rounds, and can use Regular, High Velocity, Split Point, Express and
        Explosive repeater ammo.
      </p>
      <h3>Evans repeater</h3>

      <p>
        The B.D. & Co. Evans Repeater rifle has a high bullet capacity and is
        devastating at medium and long range, with an especially high rate of
        fire. This gun can use Regular, High Velocity, Split Point, Express and
        Explosive repeater ammo. It also has customization options, including
        Stocks, Sights and Wraps.
      </p>
      <h3>Lancaster repeater</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/lancasterepeater.png"
        alt=""
        width="400"
        height="400"
        class="img1"
      />
      <p>
        The Lancaster Repeater is a well-rounded gun that uses a fast
        lever-action system to load the next cartridge. It has the lowest damage
        of all repeating rifles, but the quick firing rate and high accuracy
        give it the advantage. This gun has an ammo capacity of fourteen rounds,
        and can use Regular, High Velocity, Split Point, Express and Explosive
        repeater ammo
      </p>
      <h3>Litchfield repeater</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/litchfieldrepeater.png"
        alt=""
        width="400"
        height="400"
        class="img1"
      />
      <p>
        The Litchfield Repeater is a great choice for hunting, with the best
        damage of all repeating rifles and a large ammo capacity. Despite a
        slower fire rate and reload speed, the Litchfield excels at medium range
        combat; perfect when needing to clear an area. While very damaging, the
        accuracy of the gun can become a issue while moving or at distances.

      <h3>Varmint rifle</h3>

      <p>
        The quick-firing Lancaster Varmint Rifle is designed for hunting small
        mammals and large birds, using a special low-caliber type of ammunition
        with reduced damage. However, the large ammo capacity and fast fire rate
        make this an effective weapon against large groups of enemies. This gun
        has an ammo capacity of fourteen rounds, and can only use .22 caliber
        ammo.
      </p>
      <h3>Springfield rifle</h3>

      <p>
        A military favorite, the Lancaster Springfield is a powerful
        breech-loading weapon designed for medium to long-range combat. The high
        accuracy makes this weapon effective against large mammals, but the slow
        firing rate may be an issue when trapped in close quarters. This gun is
        a single-shot weapon, and can use Regular, High Velocity, Split Point,
        Express and Explosive rifle ammo.
      </p>
      <h3>Bolt action rifle</h3>
      <img

      <p>
        The B.D. & Co. Bolt Action is a strong and versatile rifle, built to

        firing and reloading, making this rifle an ideal choice for long-range
        combat with multiple targets. This gun has an ammo capacity of five
        rounds, and can use Regular, High Velocity, Split Point, Express and
        Explosive rifle ammo.

        powerful long scoped rifle, designed for long-range combat. With

        sharpshooter can eliminate a target from afar and gain the element of
        surprise. This gun is a single-shot weapon, and can use Regular, High
        Velocity, Split Point, Express and Explosive rifle ammo.
      </p>
      <h3>Carcano rifle</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/carcanorifle.png"
        alt=""
        width="400"

      />
      <p>
        The Sireno Carcano is a long scoped bolt-action rifle that can hold
        several rounds at once. When combined with the fast firing rate and
        quick reload speed, this makes it ideal for facing several enemies in
        long-distance combat. This gun has an ammo capacity of six rounds, and
        can use Regular, High Velocity, Split Point, Express, and Explosive
        rifle ammo.
      </p>
      <h3>Elephant rifle</h3>
      <img
        src="../assets/elephantgunrifle.png"

      <p>
        The Elephant Gun Rifle from MÃ¼hlberg is a marvel of manufacturing and
        has been likened to holding a cannon, boasting a higher stopping power
        than nearly every other gun in Red Dead Online. However, it is stopped
        short of being overpowered by its two round capacity and low total
        ammunition carried (with a maximum of 38 Nitro Express rounds in
        reserve). Its ammunition is also relatively expensive for how little is
        bought, and it has wide spread, poor range and high recoil with a slow
        fire rate. Its damage ensures it almost always gets a one-shot kill on
        both players and NPCs. It is useful for hunting legendary animals but
        not regular animals, as it will reduce pelts to poor quality. Overall,
        it is more of a novelty weapon than a practical purchase, but can be
        effective in certain situations.
